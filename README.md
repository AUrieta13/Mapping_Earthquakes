# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Analysis:
Our mission was to deliver a map that could display the earthquake data in relation with the tectonic plates' location on the planet. An additional map was also added that displayed all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.

### GeoJSON Data Utilized:
- https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson
- https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json

### JavaScript library Utilized: Leaflet
